# MyReads Project

This project is the final assessment for Udacity's React Fundamentals Course. A template of static CSS and HTML was provided and the student had to implement the React code.

## App Details

Users of this app can view books on three separate shelves: 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read'.
Each book has a selector button that allows the user to move the books between shelves, with the current shelf selected as the default highlighted option on the button. Users can also search for new books to add to the shelves using a limited number of search terms (due to the nature of the API used in the project rubric).

### How to use

* git clone this repo
* install npm
* run: npm start
* app will be available on localhost:3000

#### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
